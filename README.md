**SmartPath**: Personalized Career Recommendation System.

*****

## Introduction / Background

In today’s global economy, the job market is evolving rapidly due to technology, automation, and changing skill demands. Meanwhile, students and job seekers—especially youth in underserved areas—struggle to make informed career decisions due to limited access to personalized, up-to-date guidance.
Traditional career counseling services are often generic, inaccessible, or disconnected from real-world occupational data. As a result, many individuals pursue careers misaligned with their potential, leading to underemployment, poor job satisfaction, and wasted educational resources.
SmartPath aims to address this gap by leveraging data from the O*NET occupational database to offer intelligent, personalized career recommendations based on a user's skills, interests, and education level.

## Project Goal / Objective

SmartPath aims to build a personalized, data-driven career recommendation system that:

-Aligns individual users with career paths based on their unique skills, interests, and educational background.
-Recommends alternative or adjacent careers that fit their profile.
-Provides insights into job requirements, skill gaps, and occupational attributes.
-Empowers users to make confident, informed career decisions using structured occupational data.

## Scope of the Project

The project will:
-Use structured occupational data to model job profiles.
-Accept user input related to skills, interests (RIASEC), and education level.
-Compute similarity between the user’s profile and job profiles to generate career recommendations.
-Display top matches, skill requirements, job descriptions, and related occupations.
-Provide a simple user interface to interact with the recommendation engine.

## Data Sources

-**O*NET 29.3 Database**.Contains detailed information on occupations, including required skills, knowledge areas, work context, interests (RIASEC), education levels, and more.
-There are several datasets like Education, training and experience, interests, related occupations, skills, tools used, technology skills, work styles, work values and occupation data
